🌿 Green-Watt Energy Solution
📌 Overview
Green-Watt Energy Solution is a Machine Learning project that predicts air turbine power output using real-world energy data.
The model helps in understanding energy behavior and provides predictive insights for sustainable energy applications.

🚀 Objective
To build a predictive model that accurately estimates the power of an air turbine based on provided features from the dataset.
This can support energy analysts and engineers in performance optimization.

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
We used the Random Forest Regressor — a powerful ensemble algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions for improved accuracy and reduced overfitting.

Benefits of Random Forest:

1.Handles non-linear relationships
2.Works well with structured/tabular data
3.Robust to noise and outliers
